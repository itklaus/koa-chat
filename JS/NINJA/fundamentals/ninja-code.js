// Programmer ninjas of the past used these tricks to make code maintainers cry.

// Brevity is the soul of wit
// For instance, take a look at this ternary operator '?':
// taken from a well-know javascript libary
i = i ? i < 0 ? Math.max(0, len + i)


// One-letter variables:
// The Dao hides in wordlessness. Only the Dao is well begun and well completed. Laozi (Tao Te Ching)


// Use abbreviations
// list => lst
// userAgent => ua
// browser => brsr


// The hardest thing of all is to find a black cat in a dark room, especially if there is no cat. Confucius


// A smart ninja puts underscores at one spot of code and evades them at other places. That makes the code even more fragile and increases the probability of future errors.


// Overlap outer variables


// Powerful functions
// The great Tao flows everywhere,
// both to the left and to the right.
