To check for the largest available value or smallest available value within +/-Infinity, you can use the constants Number.MAX_VALUE or Number.MIN_VALUE and starting with ECMAScript 6, you are also able to check if a number is in the double-precision floating-point number range using Number.isSafeInteger() as well as Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER. Beyond this range, integers in JavaScript are not safe anymore and will be a double-precision floating point approximation of the value.
